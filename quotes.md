> The pleasures of youth and love are fled away: there was a goof time once, but now that is gone, and lige is no longer life.
> Some complain og the slights which are put upon them by relations, and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause.
> But to me, Socrates, these complainers seem to blame that whixh is not really in fault. For if old age were the cause, T too being old, and every other old man, would have felt as they do.
> But this is not my own wxoerience, nor that of others whom I have known. [...]
> For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom; when the passions relax their hold, then, [...] we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only, but of many.

> for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age, but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a burden.
